Answers to questions

Q1: What is a promise?
A1: As it name says, a “Promise” is an function whose execution time is variable but finite.
It can't say when it will stop so it “promises” to stop someday and you can give it a code to
execute once it’s done.

Q2: whats the goal of a promise?
A2: The goal of a promise is to send the unknown execution time process on another thread
 so that the main thread is able to keep receiving incoming calls. 

Q3: What is purpose of async/await?
A3: It is just another way of consuming a promise based function. Behind the scenes the code
 is executed the same as promise (then, catch).

Winston vs Bunyan
I will prefer using Winston. 
- Bunyan out of the box logs JSON lines but Winston can be configured to do that. 
- Bunyan needs no additional dependency to log daily and rotate log file but Winston does.
Bunyan is designed for nodejs and Winston is made to run on many platforms. This is the
 main reason that motivates my choice plus the fact that Winston is really easier to configure.
